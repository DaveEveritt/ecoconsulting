iPython

Welcome to IPython. I will try to create a personal configuration directory
where you can customize many aspects of IPython's functionality in:

/Users/deveritt/.ipython
Initializing from configuration: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/UserConfig

Successful installation!

Please read the sections 'Initial Configuration' and 'Quick Tips' in the
IPython manual (there are both HTML and PDF versions supplied with the
distribution) to make sure that your system environment is properly configured
to take advantage of IPython's features.

Important note: the configuration system has changed! The old system is
still in place, but its setting may be partly overridden by the settings in 
"~/.ipython/ipy_user_conf.py" config file. Please take a look at the file 
if some of the new settings bother you.
