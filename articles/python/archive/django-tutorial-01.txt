Learning Django 0.96 with Python 2.5.1 on Mac OS X 10.4
http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/0.96/tutorial01/

1. Decide where to put the files for your Django project
Using the Finder, go to the place you want your files to be created and stored. If you're not sure where, for this tutorial create a folder called 'django-learning' in your Home directory [how]. Don't put your project inside any folders called 'Sites' [why]


2. Create the project
In Terminal:
go to your new folder:
cd django-project
type:
django-admin.py startproject mysite
You'll see the new files in ~/django-learning/mysite [where]

In Terminal go to your new mysite driectory:
	cd mysite

Keep a Finder window open for 'mysite' to see the files Django creates.

You will be opening them for editing later.


3. Start the Python server
In Terminal:
python manage.py runserver

You should see something like:
	Validating models...
	0 errors found.
	
	Django version 0.96, using settings 'mysite.settings'
	Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
	Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

Test above the address in your browser:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/

You should see a web page with the title:
	"It worked!
	Congratulations on your first Django-powered page.


4. Edit settings.py

DATABASE_ENGINE = 'sqlite3'
DATABASE_NAME = '/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/django-learning/mysite/mydata.db'

Get the above path accurately by typing pwd in Terminal and copying the result.


5. Make the database

In Terminal, go to mysite and type:
	python manage.py syncdb

You'll see some lines of text, then be prompted with this (answer with 'yes' as shown below):
	You just installed Django's auth system, which means you don't have any superusers defined.
	Would you like to create one now? (yes/no): yes

You'll be asked to set up a Username enter your email and a Password
	Username (Leave blank to use 'YOUR_USER_NAME_WILL_BE_HERE'): 
	E-mail address: 
	Password: 

You'll see somthing like:
	Superuser created successfully.
	Installing index for auth.Message model
	Installing index for auth.Permission model
	Loading 'initial_data' fixtures...
	No fixtures found.

Which is fine.

(Optional) See the database by entering in Terminal:
	sqlite3 ~/django-learning/mysite/mydata.db

To get out of the SQLite shell and back to the Terminal command line, type:
	.quit
	

6. Create an application

In Terminal, type:
	python manage.py startapp polls



7. Add your 'models'

The first step in writing a web application in Django is to define your 'models'.
These provide your database layout, with additional metadata.

Open the new 'polls' folder in 'mysite', find 'models.py' and open it in a good text editor [why].

Replace its contents with:
-----------

from django.db import models

class Poll(models.Model):
    question = models.CharField(maxlength=200)
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')

class Choice(models.Model):
    poll = models.ForeignKey(Poll)
    choice = models.CharField(maxlength=200)
    votes = models.IntegerField()

-----------


8. Tell Django to include your new application

Open the file 'settings.py' in the mysite directory.

Find the block (towards the end) that starts:
INSTALLED_APPS = (

Add the following line (with the indent) before the right bracket:
	'mysite.polls'

The block should now look like this:

-----------

INSTALLED_APPS = (
	'django.contrib.auth',
	'django.contrib.contenttypes',
	'django.contrib.sessions',
	'django.contrib.sites',
	'mysite.polls'
)

-----------

In Terminal, type:
	python manage.py sql polls

You should then see this:

BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE "polls_poll" (
    "id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "question" varchar(200) NOT NULL,
    "pub_date" datetime NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE "polls_choice" (
    "id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "poll_id" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "polls_poll" ("id"),
    "choice" varchar(200) NOT NULL,
    "votes" integer NOT NULL
);
COMMIT;

If there's an error at this stage, I can help you no more.


9. Create the new model tables in the database

In Terminal, type:
	manage.py syncdb

You should then see this:

Creating table polls_poll
Creating table polls_choice
Installing index for polls.Choice model
Loading 'initial_data' fixtures...
No fixtures found.
