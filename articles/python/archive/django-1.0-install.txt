from: http://www.djangoproject.com/download/

(Check for minimal version of Python. If < 2.2 get Python 2.4, .5 or .6)

Download the latest official release of Django directly from:
http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.0/tarball/

double-click the tarball: Django-1.0.tar.gz

open terminal and type: cd
add a space after it and drag the folder Django-1.0 to the Terminal window - this will add the path to that folder.
Press return. You are now in the Django-1.0 folder.

type: sudo python setup.py install
enter your password.

screenfuls of text will fly by.

When they stop, type: python
this starts the Python shell - you'll see 3 right-pointing arrows like this:
>>>

type: import django
if you see 3 more arrows as above, all is well!

if you don't trust this and want visible proof, type: django.VERSION
You should see (the Django shell will 'reply'):
(1, 0, 'final')

which shows you've definitely installed Django version 1.0.

Type ctrl d (hold down the control key and press 'd') to leave the python shell.

Get on with the tutorial!

Where is Django?
If you want to know where Django lives on your system, type this into Terminal:
python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib()"

You'll see something like (for Python versions 2.5 or 2.6):
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django/
or
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages

Problem 1: 'command not found'
Your system can't find the Django admin file:
django-admin.py: command not found
type into Terminal:
cd ~
open .bash_login
if it doesn't exist, type ls -al and look for a file called .profile
if that doesn't exist either, type: touch .bash_login
then
open .bash_login
it will open in a plain text editor

Search in the Finder for: django-admin.py
Open the folder that contains it (depending on your version of Python, it will be something like): /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/django/bin/
drag the 'bin' folder to Terminal and copy the exact path it shows.
in the .bash_login file, type in the following:
export PATH="PASTE_YOUR_PATH_HERE:$PATH"
NOTE: leave off the trailing slash after /bin

--
Problem 2: 'Permission denied'
The Django admin file is not executable (can't be run):
(YOUR_PATH_HERE)/django-admin.py: Permission denied
copy the long path including django-admin.py and type (note the spaces!):
sudo chmod +x (paste your path to Django here)
enter your password.
if no error messages appear - you've done it.
