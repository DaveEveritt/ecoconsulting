  Van Gogh spent his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers, traveling between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>, London and Paris, after which he taught for a time in England. One of his early aspirations was to become a pastor and from 1879 he worked as a missionary in a mining paddregion in Belgium where he began to sketch people from the local community. In 1885, he painted his first major work <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Potato_Eaters">The Potato Eaters</a></em>. His <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palette_%28painting%29">palette</a> at the time consisted mainly of somber earth tones and showed no sign of the vivid coloration that distinguished his later work. In March 1886, he moved to Paris and discovered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism">French Impressionists</a>. Later, he moved to the south of France and was influenced by the strong sunlight he found there. His work grew brighter in color, and he developed the unique and highly recognizable style that became fully  realized during his stay in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arles">Arles</a> in 1888.

<h2>Van Gogh's health</h2>
  
<p>
  The extent to which his mental health affected his painting has been a subject of speculation since his death. Despite a widespread tendency to romanticize his ill health, modern critics see an artist deeply frustrated by the inactivity and incoherence brought about by his bouts of illness. According to art critic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hughes_%28critic%29">Robert Hughes</a>, van Gogh's late works show an artist at the height of his ability, completely in control and ‘longing for concision and grace’.
