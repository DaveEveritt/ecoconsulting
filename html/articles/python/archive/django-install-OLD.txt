Which inspired my to do these 'absurdly simple' instructions. Well, as simple as possible.

It is condensed from 'How to install Django':
	http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/0.96/install/
DON'T use these instructions by mistake:
	http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/install/

If you want more information use the [why] links.

I also include references used at the end.

This is a draft, the final version will be a proper web page. Mail deveritt[at]innotts.co.uk if you have anything to say about it.


0. Will this guide be useful for you?

This guide covers only what's needed to try out Django (using SQLite as a database) to do some tutorials. It isn't for real development.

So the answer is yes only if you:
	run a version of Mac OS X 10.4
	haven't already installed Django
	don't yet need to build a real site with Django
	want to get a feel for the Django by doing the tutorials
	find other instructions confusing or conflicting
	know how to open Apple's Terminal application
	are logged into OS X as a user with admin privileges

To keep things simple, it avoids Subversion or Macports [why].

If you want to start developing a real site, I don't yet have a guide for that :-)

There are points at which I say 'I can help no more', for the simple reason that I cannot control your computer to find out what's wrong.

Whenever there's an instruction to type something into Terminal, type in the exact command (copy and paste it if you like) shown on the line below and press return.


1. Install Apple's Xcode Tools (unless you already have them)

You can get the latest version [why] from:
	http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/


2. Check your version of Python

In Terminal, type:
	python -V

(that's a minus sign and a capital V)

If the version is 2.4 or less and you haven't done anything you really want to keep with the older version, install Python 2.5.1 [why] from:
	http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.5.1/python-2.5.1-macosx.dmg

The installer puts:
	some extra Python applications in "Applications/MacPython 2.5",
	command-line tools in /usr/local/bin
	and underlying machinery in
	/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework.

In Terminal, type:
	python -V

to check the new version number. If it's still 2.3.something or 2.4.something, I can help no more.


3. Install Django 0.96

Get the latest stable version from:
	http://www.djangoproject.com/download/0.96/tarball/
	(parent: http://www.djangoproject.com/download/)

Open Terminal and go to where your downloads are (Desktop?)

Enter each of these in Terminal:
	tar xzvf Django-0.96.tar.gz
	cd Django-0.96
	sudo python setup.py install

In Terminal, type:
	django-admin.py

if this works
	you get a screen of instructions (ignore them at this stage).
If it gives an error:
	Open .bash_login and add the path to django-admin.py:
	export PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django/bin:$PATH"
	Make django-admin.py executable by typing in Terminal:
	chmod +x /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django/bin/django-admin.py

Now try importing Django - in Terminal, type:
	python
You'll get the Python prompt, which looks like this
>>> 
then type:
>>> import django

if you get a blank line and cursor (possibly blinking accodring to your Terminal settings),
	all is well.
if you see something that ends with: ImportError: No module named django,
	I can help no more.

5. Install PySQLite

The sqlite3 database itself is part of Mac OS X 10.4 so you don't need to install it.
Its path is
	Õ/usr/bin/sqlite3Õ.

You just need PySQLite to allow Python to communicate with it.

Download PySQLite from:
	http://initd.org/pub/software/pysqlite/releases/2.3/2.3.5/pysqlite-2.3.5.tar.gz
(parent: http://initd.org/tracker/pysqlite/wiki/pysqlite)

In Terminal, go to where this has downloaded (Desktop?) [why]
Enter each of these in Terminal:
	tar xzvf pysqlite-2.3.5.tar.gz
	cd pysqlite-2.3.5

Enter what the following page suggests:
	http://initd.org/pub/software/pysqlite/doc/install-source.html
in Terminal:
	python setup.py build

then:
	sudo python setup.py install

Test it in the Python shell by typing in Terminal:
	python
when you see:
>>> 
type:
>>> from pysqlite2 import test
>>> test.test()

You'll get a line of dots - let it complete the test (when you'll see the cursor on a blank line).

Ignore any error [why] that starts:
	FAIL: CheckOnConflictRollback (pysqlite2.test.regression.RegressionTests)

Hit control-D to get out of the python shell.


YOU'RE FINALLY READY TO START DJANGO TUTORIAL 01!
