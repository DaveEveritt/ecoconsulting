		<h1>Strategy, thinking and project management</h1>

		<p>Our real strength lies in an understanding of the way things are going, knowing what trends to test and which to avoid, and a practical knowledge of the pitfalls inherent in being too 'previous'.</p>

		<p>Eco Consulting's partners have been members of several teams formed to explore new thinking about ethical, social and environmental policies.</p>
		
		<h2>Five benefits of good strategic input</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>better communication between departments</li>
			<li>more effective IT strategy and choices</li>
			<li>longevity of systems continuity in valuable knowledge</li>
			<li>greater cost efficiency and planning</li>
			<li>relaxation = productivity</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Details and long-term relationships</h2>

		<p>On the basis of these strengths, combined with our long-term relations with associates and clients, we are able to undertake project management for large information-rich websites, as well as for local individuals, with the same attention to detail and patience for the way different people like to work.</p>
		
		<h2>Agile guidelines</h2>

		<p>Here are the first of a series of concise features that attempt to condense what I've learned from being a successfully self-employed partner of Eco Consulting since 1992. I like the <cite>agile</cite> meme and try to apply it to all my activities.</p>

		<dl title="features on agile approaches to work">

			<dt><a href="./agile_project_management.shtml">Guidelines for agile project management</a></dt>
			<dd>seven brief guidelines focussing on the essentials of successful project management, without the clutter.</dd>

			<dt><a href="./agile_freelancing.shtml">Guidelines for the agile freelancer</a></dt>
			<dd>some of these guidelines challenge traditional business thinking, but they might help you prosper as a freelance.</dd>
