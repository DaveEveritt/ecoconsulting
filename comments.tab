/strategy/agile_project_management.shtml	Approved	Thu Mar 11 22:21 2010	Ron Herrema	rherrema@gmail.com	This is a helpful list. I've just started reading Richard Carlson's 'Don't Sweat the Small Stuff at Work', which isn't about efficiency but about how to cope with the inevitable stresses of inefficient systems. One thing he talks about is the importance of acknowledging people's efforts, and I've found that this is something that lots of managers miss. 'Continuous improvement' is like a form of torture. People need to know that they're making a positive difference. (btw, thanks for the Paul Graham link)

/articles/index.shtml	Approved	Sun Nov 11 11:58 2012	Naomi Oak	naomi@masonvalleytutors.com	Thank you for having such a useful page. I'm a tutor and one of my students and I came across your Eco Consulting web site's training resources page when we were researching graphic and web design resources, a topic she's interested in, while practicing and improving her researching skills. Your page has great resources that my student will learn a lot from while exploring the page.<br /><br />I also want to recommend an article that we found with <a href="http://www.crucial.com.au/graphic-design-an-integral-part-of-web-design.php">information and resources about graphic design</a>. My student thinks that the article would be a great additional design related resource on your web site's training resources page and asked me to send it to you. I thought this could also be a great opportunity to teach her, and some of the other students I tutor, about the importance of sharing information with others.

/articles/css_includes.shtml	Approved	Wed Jul 28 16:34 2010	Matt	mvw1@cornell.edu	Thanks for the nice, encapsulated description of how to do this. Wasn't easy to find this page, but I appreciate you putting it together!<br />I haven't experimented with this yet, but have an important question about how this affects the "last modified" HTTP header delivered with the file to the browser - is the date passed to the browser requesting the file the same as the last modified date of the .cssi file itself, or is it the date on which it was processed (ie the time of the HTTP request, meaning that cached versions will always expire?  If the latter - any control over that to change it and make it the former?
/articles/css_includes.shtml	Approved	Tue Dec 14 11:28 2010	BJ		Thanks for this.<br />I am a n00b to Apache related things, but have knowledge of CSS and Javascript. Does this allow for dynamic colour switching with Javascript by simply changing the value of said variables?<br />My gut says no, but it's worth an ask as I can't test it right now.<br />Thanks again, very useful info.
/articles/css_includes.shtml	Approved	Wed Jan  5 14:16 2011	BJ	seimeibunny {A.T} gmail d.o.t com	THANK YOU!!<br />I finally got this working and as noob to all things server related (various web design experience, but never had to manage a server before), this post was a god send.<br />I had to use an .htaccess file to get it to work as I don't have full apache control. For anyone in a similar situation, I used this .htaccess file:<br />AddType text/html .cssi<br />AddHandler server-parsed .cssi<br />Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes
/articles/css_includes.shtml	Approved	Thu Jan  6 14:57 2011	Dave Everitt		@BJ: glad you got it working - I find it's good for simple variables like the color property. Whereas less.js offers much more, sometimes you don't need all that functionality. As for the Javascript, that should still work, because it manipulates the rendered code, and not your .cssi source.<br />@Matt: good point, and I promise to get back to you with a definitive answer, once some annoying paid work is out of the way!
/articles/css_includes.shtml	Approved	Mon Aug 20 15:06 2012	Ruth	joga@ahj.pl	I also agree that it is not good to be loading PHP for every style sheet. If you load one PHP page with two 'dynamic' style sheets, that's 3 PHP calls for every loaded page, for every visitor. That will add up real quick if/when your website starts to pull traffic. The best thing to do is leave the stylesheets static. If you need to add dynamic style information, include it in the actual web page in style tags. Cigraphics is on the right track for re-generating static style sheets when changes are made to the website, but then you have to worry about browsers caching their CSS sheets because they are expected to be static. I know there are workarounds for that, but why worry about it? Just include any dynamic content in the main web page.

/articles/mongo-osx-install.shtml	Approved	Tue Feb  7 15:15 2012	Hengki	jacques.parsi@wanadoo.fr	Hi That is very useful, I was using a previous version of Spring Data for mongodb and struggled migrating to the new one.
/articles/mongo-osx-install.shtml	Approved	Sun Feb 12 00:11 2012	Nacho	slut@hotmail.com	There are soanttiius where installing the software is simply denied/unfavorable, normally happens in case of CI (Continuous integration) testing with Bamboo or Hudson. Where the machine running the server has no MongoDB installed. It is likely that all the persistence and even business tests fail badly. I am not able to find the solution until now, however, do you have any idea to unit test the application in such circumstances. Thanks for sharing your experiences in advance!
/articles/mongo-osx-install.shtml	Approved	Sun Feb 24 00:11 2012	Dave Everitt	deveritt@innotts.co.uk	@Nacho I'm afraid in that case, I can only suggest using a local setup for your testing.
/articles/mongo-osx-install.shtml	Approved	Sat Feb 25 13:01 2012	Amarsingh	olof.cronberg@abc.se	I ran into a slimiar issue using the Java driver connecting to a server (mongod.exe).  Make sure you use the -rest flag.  That seemed to work for me. 
/articles/mongo-osx-install.shtml	Approved	Wed Feb 29 16:15 2012	Briptu	rpozniak@hallmarkhealth.org	Nicely stated. If you use a much less structured DB, you create structure at the app layer.  In the end, you just have to decide what you care to build and what you don't.  In the case of Mongo, I've enjoyed it thus far and hope to find some scaling points in the not so distant future.
